## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**KingPrinceee/KingPrinceee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Im currently working on starting a new career within bioinformartics or a discpline similar (data science). I am here because I have developed the understanding that this platform can allow one to upload various projects/code that can not only change the world but, showcase one's skill. I am here for the latter. I will find old examples of code from academia and new projects to boost my chances of starting a new career and chapter in my life. Really hope this all goes well....
